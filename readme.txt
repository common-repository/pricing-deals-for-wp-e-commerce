Realtime Catalog Price Reductions

*   You can create rules which reduce the product price as it displays in your store catalog, based on a wide range of variables (by Wholesale, Membership, Logged-in Role, Category, and others),   

Cart Discounts

*   You can create rules which apply discounts to prices shown in the customer's shopping cart.  Dynamic pricing in the cart, by just about any grouping or deal you can think of. 

Sales, Promotions and Advertising

*   Your Pricing Deals can be advertised anywhere in your site using a variety of shortcodes, which display the rule deal message.  For example, "1 Week Special - Buy a laptop, get a free mouse" can be placed on your home page with a single shortcode.     
    
Category Pricing (and more)

*   You can create rules which apply discounts to a category or group of categories.  For example, "T-Shirts 10% off - 1 day sale"     
    
Group Pricing

*   You can create rules which apply discounts to a defined group of products.  For example, carrots are $2 each.  "Buy 3 Carrots for $5" 

Buy one, get one

*   You can create rules which apply BOGO discounts to a defined group of products.  For example, "Buy a sweatshirt, get a free baseball cap"
*   If an item is offered for free in this rule, you may elect to automatically insert the free product into the cart when the 'Buy' product is added to the cart.     

Wholesaler, Membership or Role Pricing (different prices for logged in users) 

*   You can create rules which apply pricing tiers to logged in roles.

Per Customer Discount Limits 

*   You can create rules which are limited to a single use per customer.
    
Your Cart Widget can show all discounts realtime
