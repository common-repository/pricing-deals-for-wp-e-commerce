Installing "You Save" and "Old Price" messages in your Theme (available only for Realtime Rules)
*****************************************************

Installing "You Save" and "Old Price" messages in your Theme (available only for Realtime Rules)
Your theme contains the following four files, which all require changes, in order to display Pricing Deal "Yousave" and "Old Price" messages. Please note that the "You Save" and "Old Price" functionality for regular sale pricing will remain in effect.

    "wpsc-grid_view.php"
    "wpsc-list_view.php"
    "wpsc-products_page"
    "wpsc-single_product.php"

Find the sample version of these same files. Look in vt-pricing-deals-for-wp-e-commerce/wpsc-integration folders for step-by-step instructions.
Apply the changes you find in the appropriate sample folder, to your matching theme files.

    "Sample wpsc-theme before 3.8.9" folder
        Within Each of the files, "You Save" and "Old Price" generation are controlled by individual code areas:
        If Pricing Deal "You Save" message should be turned off, simply do not make the "You Save" code changes listed.
        If Pricing Deal "Old Price" message should be turned off, simply do not make the "Old Price" code changes listed.
    "Sample wpsc-theme 3.8.9+" folder
        Within Each of the files, there are options noted for "You Save" and "Old Price" generation:
        vtprd_the_product_price_display(); => Shows both the Old Price and You Save messages
        vtprd_the_product_price_display( array( "output_old_price" => false ) ); => Turns off the Old Price message
        vtprd_the_product_price_display( array( "output_you_save" => false ) ); => Turns off the You Save message
        vtprd_the_product_price_display( array( "output_old_price" => false, "output_you_save" => false ) ); => Turns off both messages

Choose the folder which matches your WP E-Commerce release, and find the file name within the folder matching each file in your theme.

    Apply the changes from the each sample file to your active theme version of the file.
    If your Active Theme has child-theme capability, place the changed file into the child-theme folder, and you are done.
    And you will never have to update this file again, unless your custom theme changes this file on update.
    If your Active Theme does not have child-theme capability, replace "wpsc-cart_widget.php" where you found it in your theme area.
    In this case, Each time your theme updates, you will want to check the "wpsc-cart_widget.php", and re-apply the changes as necessary.
